# Todo

## Description

This is the frontend for Todo, a project management system. It is similar in functionality to Jira or Trello. It allows users to create projects and tickets and assign them to any users apart of the project. Additionally, Todo supports functionality for a fully customizable Kanban board. The frontend utilizes Vue.js and uses Tailwind to simplify the CSS. Currently, development for the frontend still ongoing, but the server is almost fully complete.
